Illustrator Script - Merge Selected Anchors

There is a freely available script called "merge overlapped anchors" that has been around a long time.  I find it useful from time to time, but wanted a way to merge overlapped anchors for only "selected" anchors, rather than the entire path all at once (though that's very useful, it's not always my goal).

In searching, Copilot popped up here on github with Chat GPT 4o loaded, and it asked me if I would like it to try scripting one.  I fed it the old script by SATO Hiroyuki and in a couple attempts, to my suprise, it had a working variant of the script that did just this.  I do not know illustrator scripting, so I found this suprising and very useful, and thought I'd share the result here freely for anyone else to use if they find it beneficial!

To reference the original scripts disclaimer:

// This script provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.

// Free to use and distribute.

Feel free to give it a try, and here's hoping someone out there finds it useful!
